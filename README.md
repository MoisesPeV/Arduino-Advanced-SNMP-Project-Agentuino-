In this project, the free-to-use library Agentuino is used to develop an advanced project for managing certain variables (see .mib file)
on an Arduino Mega 2560 board, with a W5100 for Ethernet connectivity.

3 management groups are implemented:
                       -Information
                       -Sensors (reading values)
                       -Events
